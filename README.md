# IMS_CRUD ```java```
## crud based inventory management system - back end focus

> * Create function added: user can now add a record to the lab equipment table in the labs database
> * Read function added: user can now read what is contained in the equipment table of the labs database

>>     The user will be asked to choose either store or read, store will lead to a sequence of prompts for the user to input specific column values, while read will display the contents of the table in a list. After each function completes, the user will be asked if they wish to continue, inputting 'y' will return user to function choice while inputting 'n' will close the connection and terminate the application.
